# American Hospital Association Survey Data Analysis

American Hospital Association (AHA) is a national organization that represents hospitals and their patients, and acts as a source of information on health care issues and trends. Each year AHA produces the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. The intent of the HCAHPS initiative is to provide a standardized survey instrument for measuring patientsâ€™ perspectives on hospital care in order to create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care. 
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the results for the last 9 years aiming to answer the following questions:

1. How many areas are measured in the survey?
2. How many years of survey are available in the data?
3. What was the year where most hospitals participated in the survey?
4. What state have the highest average response rate for each survey year?
5. What areas measured received the worst and best results in the lastest released survey nationally?
6. all areas received an average of ##% poor rating which is good to start with. 
7. What states had the most complited surveys?
8. What state has the best response rate?
9. What state has the worst average and the best average
10. Have hospitals' HCAHPS scores improved over the past 9 years?
11. Are there any specific areas where hospitals have made more progress than others?
12. Are there any major areas of opportunity remaining?
13. What recommendations can you make to hospitals to help them further improve the patient experience?


## About the Data

The HCAHPS survey data base contains seven tables:
* Questions - Questions asked to patients as it appears on the HCAHPS survey.
* Measures - Hospital areas measured in the survey such as 'Communication with Nurses' and 'Responsiveness of Hospital Staff'.
* Report - Survey results released periods.
* State - State abbreviation for the 50 US States (plus DC - District of Columbia).
* Responses - Surveys completed and response rates from patients by facility.
* State Results - Survey results by state.
* National Results - Survey results nationally.

The following is the entity relationship diagram that shows each how these tables relate to each other.

## Exploring the Data
1. How many areas are measured in the survey?
  ```sql
  SELECT
    DISTINCT measure AS area_measured
  FROM
    luisalva.hopitals_patients_survey.measures
  ```

2. How many years of survey are available in the data?
  ```sql
  SELECT
    DISTINCT release_period,
    start_date,
    end_date
  FROM
    luisalva.hopitals_patients_survey.reports
  ORDER BY
    release_period;
  ``` 
  
3. What was the year where most hospitals participated in the survey?

  ```sql
  SELECT
    release_period,
    COUNT(facility_id) facility_count
  FROM
    luisalva.hopitals_patients_survey.responses
  GROUP BY
    release_period
  ORDER BY
    facility_count desc;
```

4. What state have the highest average response rate for each survey year? 

```sql
SELECT
  state,
  ROUND(AVG(response_rate), 2) AS response_rate
FROM
  luisalva.hopitals_patients_survey.responses
GROUP BY
  state
ORDER BY
  response_rate DESC;
```

5. What areas measured received the worst and best results in the lastest released survey nationally? 

```sql
SELECT
  nr.release_period,
  m.measure AS area_measured,
  nr.bottom_box_percentage AS poor,
  nr.middle_box_percentage AS fair,
  nr.top_box_percentage AS good
FROM
  luisalva.hopitals_patients_survey.measures m
JOIN
  luisalva.hopitals_patients_survey.national_results nr
ON
  m.measure_id = nr.measure_id
JOIN
  luisalva.hopitals_patients_survey.reports r
ON
  nr.release_period = r.release_period
WHERE
  nr.release_period = '07_2023'
ORDER BY
  nr.release_period;
```
